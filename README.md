# Bamazon

This assignment implemented both Inquirer and MySQL during week 6 of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

The gist of this homework was to create a database on MySQL that was called “bamazon” and create a table of products that one would sell on bamazon.com

After creating the database, we had to write code that also used Inquirer to figure out what the user wanted to purchase from Bamazon and how many units they would like to purchase of that item. The amount of units they wished to buy would then be deducted on the database.
